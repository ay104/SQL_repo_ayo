<bold><h1>Introduction</h1></bold>
Rockbuster Stealth LLC (RS) is a video rental company that used to have stores across the world. Due to stiff competition from online streaming businesses like Netflix and 
Amazon Prime, the company is planning to redefine its business model and use its current movie licenses to launch online rental service to stay competitive. The Business 
Intelligence unit (BI) of RS has hired me as a data analyst to help load company's existing data on a relational database management system, RDBMS, run SQL queries to gather insights
towards preparing the launch strategy, answer day-to-day business questions of other departments (inventory, customer insights, etc.) and finally generate a comprehensive report
that answers all RS management board questions using SQL queries.

<h2>Key Questions and Objectives</h2>
RS Management Board has asked a number of questions requiring data-driven answers that are expected to build into the company's 2020 business strategy. The questions are:
<l>● Which movies contributed the most/least to revenue gain?
● What was the average rental duration for all videos?
● Which countries are Rockbuster customers based in?
● Where are customers with a high lifetime value based?
● Do sales fgures vary between geographic regions?</l>

<h3>Final Analysis Criteria</h3>
This project will be evaluated by CareeFoundry against the following learning milestones:
<l>● Ability to write moderately complex SQL queries to answer business questions.
● Presentation of SQL results to business managers by creating visualizations and telling
a compelling story.
● Presentation of SQL results to technical colleagues using Excel and by creating a
data dictionary.
● Creation of a professional project that can be added to professional portfolio and show to
employers.</l>
