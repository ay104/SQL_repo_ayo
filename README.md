Rockbuster Stealth LLC (RS) is a video rental company that used to have stores across the world. Due to stiff competition from online streaming businesses like Netflix and 
Amazon Prime, the company is planning to redefine its business model and use its current movie licenses to launch online rental service to stay competitive. The Business 
Intelligence unit (BI) of RS has hired me as a data analyst to help load company's existing data on a relational database management system, RDBMS, run SQL queries to gather insights
towards preparing the launch strategy, answer day-to-day business questions of other departments (inventory, customer insights, etc.) and finally generate a comprehensive report
that answers all management questions using SQL queries.
